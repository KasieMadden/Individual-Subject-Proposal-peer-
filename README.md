# A Cybersecurity Script Kit


>## Project Abstract
<p>For any cybersecurity professional, scripting is an important part of testing the defense of  any network or computer system. Being able to have a collection of scripts that will automate any recurring process or having set of security tools is a must for any professional in the field. Not everyone is a coding wizard, being able to have a bunch of scripts at the drop of a hat is not only helpful but convenient. The idea for this project is to create a web site that will host a small library of scrips that would complete various tasks that any beginner or expert security professional would need in the field.</p>

>## Project Relevance
<p>Within the past year, I have come to realize that cybersecurity is what I am interested in pursuing as a professional. The past few months Iâ€™ve used established GitHub repositories, Kali Linux and YouTube videos for specific scripts and tools  to help with projects and tasks. Being able to build up a library tools and scripts that I find useful is a project that I have wanted to explore for a while.<br> 
The process for this project will used different software development tools that are taught throughout this class. For version control, GitHub will be to track the work and history of the project. There will be a set a member of the team as the project manager to create miles stones and keep the group on schedule to ensure that each person is staying focused on the current task. And lastly, we will  use test driven development while creating each script to confirm that each aspect is working correctly.

>## Conceptual Design
<p>The design of this project is relatively straight  forward. The developers will create a website that will host the library of cybersecurity tools. From there the end-user can download the tool or script and use it however they desire.  </p>
<br>

>## Background
<p>This project will be from scratch and will not contribute to an already repository. The like below is some of the scripts that will be considered  for the library.</p>

***Building***
- Because this code is from scratch, the code hasn't been built yet to run. 

**Running**
- Does not have a main function. This is executable code and will run once enabled. 

## Required Resources
- Python 3 to code the scripts. 
- HTML, CSS and possibly Javascript to build the site. 
- Site will be hosted on Temples Linux server.
- Using VS code as the enviorment to create scripts
